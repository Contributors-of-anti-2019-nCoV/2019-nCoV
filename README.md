Novel coronavirus, denoted 2019-nCoV by the WHO on January 12nd, 2020, and also known as Wuhan coronavirus, Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus and Wuhan pneumonia, is a RNA coronavirus first reported in 2019. The virus was genomically sequenced after nucleic acid testing on a positive patient sample in a patient with pneumonia during the 2019–2020 Wuhan pneumonia outbreak.

No specific treatment for the new virus is currently available, but existing anti-virals could be repurposed.

Approved by the State Council，National Health Commission of China issued Announcement No. 1 of 2020 on January 20, 2020, which included pneumonia infected by the new coronavirus into a Class B infectious disease and managed as a Class A.

- The rise and fall, everyone is responsible.
- Previously, there was a project called Foldit. This is a successful case. Human thinking is used to replace part of the decision in computer algorithms. Construct the optimal three-dimensional shape of a protein is designed into a game, then achieved a great deal.
- Perhaps for some tasks of developing anti-drugs / destructuring proteins, using CS (Computer Science) / DS (Data Science) / ML (Machine Learning) / DL (Deep Learning) can help.
- We welcome all positive, constructive suggestions and advocate for mature, responsible and valuable speeches.
