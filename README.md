Novel coronavirus, [2019-nCoV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-nCoV), also known as Wuhan coronavirus, Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus and Wuhan pneumonia, is a RNA coronavirus first reported in 2019. The virus was genomically sequenced after nucleic acid testing on a positive patient sample in a patient with pneumonia during the 2019–2020 Wuhan pneumonia outbreak.

No specific treatment is currently available, but the existing anti-virals could be repurposed.

Approved by the State Council，National Health Commission of China issued Announcement No. 1 of 2020 on January 20, 2020, which included pneumonia infected by the new coronavirus into a Class B infectious disease and managed as a Class A.

- Cook meat and eggs thoroughly.

Project Origin
---

- The rise and fall, everyone is responsible.
- Previously, there was a successful project called Foldit. In that project, human thinking is used to replace part of the decision makings in the computer algorithms. Construct the optimal three-dimensional shape of a protein is designed into a game, then achieved a great deal.
- Perhaps we can use CS (Computer Science), DS (Data Science), ML (Machine Learning) and/or DL (Deep Learning) to help with 
developing anti-drugs and destructuring proteins.
- We welcome all constructive comments as well as mature, responsible and thoughtful speeches.
